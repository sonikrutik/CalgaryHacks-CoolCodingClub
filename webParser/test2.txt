appointment
Times
All times stated in this course outline, on eClass, on assessments, and in communications
from the instructor are in Mountain Time and in the 24-hour clock.
Topics
The following topics will be covered: vector spaces and subspaces; linearly independent
sets and spanning sets; bases, dimension, and change of basis; linear
transformations; diagonalization; inner product spaces; and orthogonal diagonalization
of real symmetric matrices. We will also cover some applications of
the theory, such as constrained optimization and quadratic forms.
Textbook
There is no required textbook. However, if you would like further practice beyond
the practice questions on eClass, you may wish to consult David Pooleâ€™s
Linear Algebra: A Modern Introduction, 4th edition. Most of the topics covered
in this course can be found there as well.
Prerequisites
Both (i) and (ii) are required:
(i) a 100-level linear algebra course;
(ii) a 100-level calculus course.
You will need to be able to perform basic differentiation and integration.
Grades
Your grade for the course will be calculated using the following weights:
 Assignments: 20%
 Midterm: 30%
 Final exam: 50%
Paul Buckingham MATH 225, Q1: Course Outline j 1
To be guaranteed a passing grade of D, you must achieve at least 50% in the
course overall and at least 50% in the final exam. To be guaranteed a grade
of A, you must achieve at least 90% in the course overall and at least 90% in
the final exam.
Grades are unofficial until approved by the department and faculty offering
the course.
Assignments
There will be 11 assignments, all worth the same amount. Late submissions will
not be accepted, and no extensions to assignment deadlines will be granted.
There will be no exceptions to these rules.
Your best 10 assignments will be used to calculate the assignment component
of your overall grade. In other words, your lowest assignment score will be
ignored. Any missed assignment will be given a score of zero and will be treated
as your lowest. Therefore, if you miss one of your assignments, all of the other
10 will count towards your final grade.
Where to submit assignments and exams
Assignments and exams should be submitted via Assign2. Instructions for using
Assign2 may be found here:
https://support.ctl.ualberta.ca/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/
View/439/1/submitting-assignments-using-assign2-for-students
Penalty for incorrectly oriented images in Assign2
All images uploaded to Assign2 must be the right way up. If any image is upside
down or on its side, the grader will enter a mark of zero for the corresponding
question. This rule applies to assignments and exams.
Midterm exam
The midterm exam will be held from 09:00 to 09:50 on Friday 5th March 2021.
It will be delivered remotely.
Final exam
The final exam will be 2 hours long and will be delivered remotely. The date
and time will be announced on Bear Tracks. To see the tentative date for the
final exam, please visit the universityâ€™s examinations and scheduling website:
https://www.ualberta.ca/registrar/examinations/index.html?
Note that the tentative date and time are subject to change, and only the date
and time announced on Bear Tracks should be considered final.

Use of materials in exams
Students are not permitted to use notes, books, or calculators in the exams. A
computer is allowed only for the purposes of viewing the exams and submitting
solutions to them. A phone or tablet may be used for photographing and
submitting exam solutions but for no other purpose.
Absence from the midterm exam
If incapacitating illness, severe domestic affliction, or some other compelling
reason prevents you from writing the midterm exam, then you may apply for an
excused absence. To apply for an excused absence, you must contact the instructor
within two working days of the midterm, or as soon as possible thereafter.
The instructor may request adequate documentation to substantiate the reason
for the absence.
If an excused absence is granted, the weight of the midterm will be transferred
to the final.
An excused absence is a privilege and not a right. There is no guarantee
that an absence will be excused. Misrepresentation of facts to gain an excused
absence is a serious breach of the Code of Student Behaviour1.
Missed assessments where the cause is religious belief
For an excused absence where the cause is religious belief, a student must contact
the instructor within two weeks of the start of classes to request accommodation
for the term (including the final exam, where relevant). The instructor may request
adequate documentation to substantiate the request. Students who failed
at the start of term to request exam accommodations for religious beliefs are
expected to follow the deferred final exam process outlined below.
Deferred final exam
If incapacitating illness, severe domestic affliction, or some other compelling reason
prevents you from writing the final exam, then you may apply for a deferred
final exam. Such an application must be made to your Faculty Office within two
working days of the missed exam and must be supported by appropriate documentation
or a statutory declaration2. Deferred exams are a privilege and not a
right; there is no guarantee that a deferred exam will be granted. Misrepresentation
of facts to gain a deferred exam is a serious breach of the Code of Student
Behaviour.
The deferred final exam will take place from 09:00 to 11:00 on Saturday 8th

May 2021. It will be delivered remotely.
Re-examination
A student who writes the final exam and fails the course may apply for a
re-examination. Re-examinations are rarely granted in the Faculty of Science.
Re-examinations are governed by university-wide Academic Regulations3 and
Faculty of Science Academic Regulations4. Misrepresentation of facts to gain a
re-examination is a serious breach of the Code of Student Behaviour.
Audio or video recording
Audio or video recording of lectures, labs, seminars, or any other teaching environment
by students is allowed only with the prior written consent of the
instructor or as part of an approved accommodation plan. Recorded material is
to be used solely for personal study and is not to be used or distributed for any
other purpose without the prior written consent of the instructor.
Academic integrity
The University of Alberta is committed to the highest standards of academic
integrity and honesty. Students are expected to be familiar with these standards
regarding academic honesty and to uphold the policies of the university in this
respect. Students are particularly urged to familiarize themselves with the Code
of Student Behaviour and to avoid any behaviour that could potentially result
in suspicions of cheating, plagiarism, misrepresentation of facts and/or participation
in an offence. Academic dishonesty is a serious offence and can result in
suspension or expulsion from the university.
All forms of academic dishonesty are unacceptable at the university. Any
suspected offence will be reported to the Faculty of Science. Anyone who is
found in violation of the Code of Student Behaviour may receive a sanction.
Typical sanctions include conduct probation, a mark reduction or a mark of
zero on an assessment, a grade reduction or a grade of F in a course, a remark
on the transcript, and a recommendation for suspension or expulsion.
